# heatmap service

Here is the rust microservice for serving heatmap data. This service requires a sat_data.geojson file which is generated by the ingest script in data-ingest

It requires an .env file, or the proper configuration environment variables to run.

Ex:
```
# .env
SERVER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8080 # the bind address for the microservice
CACHE_TTL=3600 # how long (in seconds) the cache should last for
GEO_JSON_PATH=/path/to/geojson
```

## Compiling Locally
1. Move `sat_data.geojson` to the `heatmap-service` directory, make sure the filename matches the `GEO_JSON_PATH` or the server will fail to find the data
3. Run `cargo run` in the terminal and you now have a locally running version of the server, if the terminal you entered this command into closes you will need to repeat this step in a new terminal
